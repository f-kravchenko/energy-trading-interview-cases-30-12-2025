Problem 2: Forecasting
Background
We need to forecast the power consumption at 09:00 on the before for the entire next day (D+1
00:00 until 24:00) due to the fact that the day-ahead power markets opens trading at 09:00 am on
the day before power consumption.
Tasks
1. Create energy consumption estimates for all 15 minute intervals of the next day
2. Please implement a pragmatic and usable solution and tell us how good it performs
3. Which data/features you would need to improve your forecast? Feel free to use any available
data you can find online or simulated data to prove it’s useful.
4. How do you handle different behavior across devices and between space heating and drinking
hot water?
5. Our forecast runs as a Celery task every day shortly before 9:00 am for day-ahead trading. For
intraday trading, the forecast needs to run at a moments notice, many times a day. What are the
architecture challenges in such a case? Please describe a useful architecture + infra on GCP +
open source frameworks that are relevant
