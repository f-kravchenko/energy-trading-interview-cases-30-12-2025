Problem 1: Steering

Background
We need to steer (control) heat pumps according to spot prices using the OEM available
commands.
Current Implementation
- Optimization Algo: Calculates modes min/low/mid/max based on a spot day-ahead price curve.
    Max: lowest price → prioritize heating (we canʼt force it); Min: highest price → avoid heating
- Scheduler: schedules celery tasks on mode change e.g. min → max
- Celery runs scheduled task with a generic command e.g. "mode change min→max"
- Specific OEM interprets the generic command and executes it by calling the OEM API e.g. for
min → max "Change heating temperature offset by 1 degree" and “Activate boost drinking hot
water modeˮ
- We log if the command was successfully sent (POST OEM API response)

Tasks
- What are problems with the current approach?
- Please implement an improved solution for it
- How can we improve the economic outcome of the steering?
- How can we improve the steering to be more robust? What edge cases do you see?
- What are the challenges with the current infrastructure? Please describe a useful architecture + infra on GCP  open source
frameworks that are relevant
